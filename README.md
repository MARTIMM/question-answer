Documentation, references and examples are (or at least, will be ðŸ˜„) displayed [here](https://martimm.github.io/question-answer/).


# Versions of involved software

* Programs and libraries are tested against the latest version of **Raku** on **Rakudo** en **Moarvm**.

* Gtk library used **Gtk 3.24**. The versioning of GTK+ is a bit different in that there is also a 3.90 and up. This is only meant as a prelude to version 4. So do not use those versions for the Raku packages.


# Installation

Simple and strait forward.

`zef install QAManager`


# Issues

There are always some problems! If you find one, please help by filing an issue at [my github project](https://github.com/MARTIMM/qa-manager/issues).
