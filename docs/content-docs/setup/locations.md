# Locations

There are several locations involved where questionaires and categories are stored. The results of the query is stored at a standard location if not changed.

Using definitions of [Free Desktop](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/);
* Sets are stored in a directory at `$*HOME/.config/QAManager/Sets.d`. On windows, this might be a bit different. The file is by default a JSON formatted file having a 'json' extention. The set name is the filename without the extention.
* Sheets are stored at `$*HOME/.config/QAManager/Sheets.d` and are also JSON formatted files by default.
* Answers returned from the sheet dialogs are stored in hashes which go into the users configuration environment `$*HOME/.config/<modified $*PROGRAM-NAME>`. The filename is named after the used sheet name. Also, the sheet is filled in from this data before presentation if there is any data.

However, it is possible to change the paths to other locations. This is important when you want to install a module or package making use of its own quetionaires but not yet placed in the QAManager environment. Because the module installation program `zef` is not aware of any files from other locations than those in the `META6.json` configuration, other actions must be executed to get the sheets at the right locations. Several methods exist to install the modules set and sheet configurations;

1) Write an installation module (`Build.pm6`) which installs the sheets at the proper location when installing your package. An example installation module to install categories and sheets is shown below;
<!--
```
use v6.d;

use QAManager::Set;
use QAManager::Question;
use QAManager::Category;
use QAManager::QATypes;

unit class Build;

method build( Str $dist-path - - > Int ) {
  make-categories;
  make-sheets;

  1;
}

make-categories ( ) {

  # create category
  my QAManager::Category $category .= new(:category-name('accounting'));

  # create a set
  my QAManager::Set $set .= new(:name<credentials>);
  $set.description = 'Set name and password for a new account';

  # 1st question and add to set
  my QAManager::Question $question .= new(:name<username>);
  $question.description = 'Username of account';
  $question.required = True;
  $set.add-question($question);

  # 2nd question and add to set
  $question .= new(:name<password>);
  $question.description = 'Password for username';
  $question.required = True;
  $question.invisible = True;
  $set.add-question($question);

  # add set to category
  $category.add-set($set);

  # create another set
  $set .= new(:name<profile>);
  # add some questions ...
  $category.add-set($set);

  # and save like an archive. category with sets are now saved
  # in QAManagers environment
  $category.save;

  # create more categories ...
}

make-sheets ( ) {
  # create a questions sheet holding the sets
  my QAManager::Sheet $sheet .= new(:sheet-name<login>);
  $sheet.display = QADialog;
  $sheet.button-map = %( "save-quit": "login");

  $sheet.new-page(:name<Login>);
  $sheet.add-set( :category<accounting>, :set<credentials>);
  $sheet.save;

  # create more sheets ...
}

```
-->

2) Keep the sheets in the resources directory and install them when programs or a module is accessed the first time.
