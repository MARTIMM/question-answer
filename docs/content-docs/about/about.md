# QAManager - Question Answer Manager

## About the program

The program came to my mind when I was devising another method to read and write a configuration file. There are several methods to handle Toml, INI or Yaml files. However, there are no consistent methods to present a series of questions which can be stored as a configuration for an application.

After that, a thought passed my mind that these configurations can be applied to other situations as well like; household lists, political invoices, installation guides, well you name it...
